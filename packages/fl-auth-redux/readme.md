Redux actions and reducer for fl-auth-*, an auth package for FounderLab apps
=======================================================================

Works alongside fl-auth-server and fl-auth-react.

-------

- login(url, email, password, callback)
    * Send a login request with the given email(username) and password to url.

- register(url, userData, callback)
    * Send a register request with the given data to url.
    * userData should contain the fields {email, password} at minimum

- resetRequest(url, email, callback)
    * Send a password reset email to the user who registered the email `email`

- reset(url, email, password, resetToken, callback)
    * Perform the password reset for a user that has requested a reset via resetRequest
    * resetToken will be present as a query param in a link from email they receive. Make sure it's picked up and passed along

- confirmEmail(url, email, token, callback)
    * Used when the user receives their email confirmation email. Pass the token back to the server.

- logout()
    * Clear the user's session and log them out.

- updateUser(user, callback)
    * Make changes to the user model directly.


accessTokenMiddleware
---------------------

Appends an access token to each request as a query string or header.
